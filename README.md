# Paint Coating Optimization 🎨

Welcome to the **Paint Coating Optimization Project**, a machine learning-based solution designed to predict paint usage and recommend the most efficient and cost-effective paint types for various environmental conditions.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses machine learning techniques to:
- Predict **paint usage** based on parameters such as **surface area**, **humidity**, **temperature**, and **number of coats**.
- Recommend the best **paint type** (e.g., Oil-Based, Water-Based, Latex) tailored to specific environmental conditions.
- Provide an interactive **dashboard** for visualization and analysis.

---

## 🛠️ Features
- **Prediction**: Accurately estimates the amount of paint required for a given job.
- **Recommendation System**: Suggests the best paint type based on input conditions.
- **Streamlit Web App**: User-friendly interface for predictions.
- **Power BI Dashboards**: Visual analysis of paint usage trends and recommendations.
- **Trained Models**: Utilizes advanced models like XGBoost for high accuracy.
